**Smart Window**

This is a Planspiel project, a module offered by the Master's program Web Engineering at Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz which focus on Modern Aspects of Software Development with development of "Startup Company". 

For this module we have created an web application named "Smart Window", which detects point of interest in real time and provides information of detected point of interest. Additionally, information like time, date,weather, station and their connecting trains are also integrated in the system.
